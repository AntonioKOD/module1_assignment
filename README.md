# Module 1: Refactoring for Accessibility

This is module 1 for the bootcamp.

## Overview
This is the first challenge of the bootcamp where I have to refactor the starter code given to me to make the website of the marketing agency more accessible. The goal is to ensure that the code meets accessibility standards, thereby improving the website's usability and its ranking on search engines.

## Changes Made
- Replaced all non-semantic elements with semantic elements to improve accessibility.
- Added `alt` attributes to all images for better accessibility.
- Changed the title to be more specific and descriptive.
- Ensured that all heading elements (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) are in sequential order.

## Benefits
- Improved accessibility for users with disabilities.
- Better overall structure and readability of the HTML code.
